# Whisper CLI Chat
A cli chat app built on top of Ethereum's Whisper protocol

Done as part of a hiring process, useful only to the extent that serves the hiring process.

This is a ___paid task___. Starting with this job, I'm trying to follow a standard of making hiring-process tasks for money, even if not useful for the examiner. My time shouldn't be given for free.

Needless to say: were I in dire need of the job, I may have accepted doing the task for free or may have not asked. Even in less difficult situations, I may accept the task being free.

Yeah, the README has no useful info on the chat app yet, only paid-tasks ideology :-)
